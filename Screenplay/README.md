# Rhovonidin: Ascendance (Screenplay)

Story: After crash landing upon the shores of Rhovonidin's Ocean Moon planet, Lance Rhovonidin can still see his home, in the stars, but now he and his crew of the *Ascendance*, now freed slaves, must ascend the valleys, hills, and mountains of the planet to reach the invincible warrior-king, Agrippa, and his endless lithium-iron-phosphate mines, to rebuild their intergalactic ship, the *Ascendance*, buried deep in the ocean, and reclaim their place amongst the stars.
